ProjectSeeHearSpeakNoEvil
=========================

This project was writen more than 6 years ago as an exploration of openCV and what I could do with it in the Processing.org enviroment.

Since I upgraded to Yosemite a lot of old Processing sketches broke, rather than fixing the problem I wanted to do a complete rewrite (JAVA is dead?).

This project takes a live videofeed (this was writen with a built-in Apple FaceTime HD camera as source). Recongnizes face(s) in it, and asigns a 'seeNoEvil', 'hearNoEvil' or 'speakNoEvil' mask to a face it finds. The mask is persistent to a face until the face disappears. The masks are assigned semi random.

This project needed to be written specifically as a 32 bit app (so no universal binaries as of yet!).

Is the ever growing surveillance state hindering us to See, Hear or Speak (name) the Evil in the world? Does the lack of privacy enforce a selfcensorship upon us?
